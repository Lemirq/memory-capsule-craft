It's hard to believe November is practically over. Today was a quiet day, mostly spent reflecting on the past few weeks. I feel like I've made some solid progress on my personal projects, especially the new app. The UI is coming together nicely, though I'm still struggling a bit with the state management.

I took a long walk this afternoon. The air is getting crisp, and the leaves are almost all gone now. It makes me feel a bit nostalgic, but also ready for winter. I need to start thinking about holiday gifts soon.

Mood: Calm, Reflective.

The energy everywhere is shifting towards the holidays. I went grocery shopping today and it was chaotic. I usually hate crowds, but today it felt kind of communal. Everyone is preparing for something.

Work has been intense. We're trying to ship a feature before the code freeze. I stayed late yesterday, which I don't like doing, but it felt necessary. I need to make sure I don't burn out before the break.

Grateful for: Hot chocolate, comfortable boots, and my cat who always knows when I need a cuddle.

Finally cracked the problem I've been stuck on for three days! It turns out it was a race condition in the database updates. Fixing it felt so satisfying. This is why I love engineering—that moment when everything clicks into place.

Celebrated by ordering sushi. I feel like I'm in a good flow state right now. I want to ride this wave as long as I can.

October is ending on a weird note. I went to a party last night, and while it was fun, I felt strangely disconnected. Maybe I'm just tired of small talk. I found myself hiding in the kitchen talking to the host's dog for twenty minutes.

I think I need to prioritize deep connections over social obligations next month. I miss having real, long conversations.

Dragging my feet today. It's the middle of October and the excitement of the new season has worn off, replaced by the grind. I skipped the gym again. That's three times this week. I need to stop beating myself up about it and just go tomorrow.

I read an interesting article about dopamine detoxing. Maybe I'm spending too much time scrolling. I'm going to try to leave my phone in the other room tonight.

The weather has finally turned. I love sweater weather. I went to the farmer's market this morning and bought way too many apples. I guess I'm making pie this weekend?

I signed up for that pottery class I've been eyeing. I'm nervous because I'm terrible at art, but I want to try something that doesn't involve a screen.

Feeling a spike of anxiety today. Not sure what triggered it. Maybe just the looming deadlines at work. I feel like I'm juggling too many balls and one is bound to drop.

I tried meditating for 10 minutes. It helped a little, but my mind kept wandering. I need to be kinder to myself. It's okay not to be perfect.

We launched the beta today! It was terrifying and exhilarating. There were a few bugs, obviously, but nothing critical. The feedback so far has been positive.

I'm exhausted but happy. It's nice to see something you worked on out in the wild. I'm going to sleep for 12 hours tonight.

Summer is definitely over. The traffic was back to normal (bad) this morning. I'm trying to get back into a routine after the vacation. It's hard. My brain is still on beach time.

I made a list of goals for the rest of the year. It looks ambitious. Maybe too ambitious? I'll review it again on Sunday.

New month, fresh start. I always feel like September is more of a new year than January. It must be the "back to school" conditioning.

I want to focus on health this month. Drinking more water, eating more greens. The usual stuff, but I really mean it this time. I feel sluggish and I want to change that.
