It's hard to believe November is practically over. Today was a quiet day, mostly spent reflecting on the past few weeks. I feel like I've made some solid progress on my personal projects, especially the new app. The UI is coming together nicely, though I'm still struggling a bit with the state management.

I took a long walk this afternoon. The air is getting crisp, and the leaves are almost all gone now. It makes me feel a bit nostalgic, but also ready for winter. I need to start thinking about holiday gifts soon.

Mood: Calm, Reflective.

The energy everywhere is shifting towards the holidays. I went grocery shopping today and it was chaotic. I usually hate crowds, but today it felt kind of communal. Everyone is preparing for something.

Work has been intense. We're trying to ship a feature before the code freeze. I stayed late yesterday, which I don't like doing, but it felt necessary. I need to make sure I don't burn out before the break.

Grateful for: Hot chocolate, comfortable boots, and my cat who always knows when I need a cuddle.

Finally cracked the problem I've been stuck on for three days! It turns out it was a race condition in the database updates. Fixing it felt so satisfying. This is why I love engineering—that moment when everything clicks into place.

Celebrated by ordering sushi. I feel like I'm in a good flow state right now. I want to ride this wave as long as I can.
