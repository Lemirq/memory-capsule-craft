**Subject**: 🧠 Memory Capsule: Turn Craft into an AI-Powered Journal 📔

Hi everyone! 👋

For the Winter Challenge, I built something to solve a personal problem: I love writing in Craft, but I missed the analytics and "insights" you get from dedicated journaling apps.

So I built **Memory Capsule**! 🚀

It’s a web dashboard that connects to your Craft docs. You write your journal in Craft, and with one click, it uses AI to analyze your day—tracking your mood, identifying themes, and even giving you reflection prompts.

**The best part?** It writes everything BACK into Craft. 🤯
Your stats, streaks, and insights are stored right inside your documents as JSON blocks. Craft is the database!

**Features:**
✨ **Mood Tracking**: Visualize your emotional trends over time.
📊 **Theme Analysis**: See what topics dominate your writing (Work? Family? Ideas?).
🔥 **Streak Tracking**: Keep the habit alive.
📅 **Yearly Rewind**: A "Wrapped" style view of your year in review.

I’ve open-sourced the code if anyone wants to run their own "Private Journaling Cloud" on top of Craft.

Check out the demo and code here: 

Happy journaling! ✍️
